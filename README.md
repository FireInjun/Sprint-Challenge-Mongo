# `FireInjun` Mongo Project



### I have organized the project into the following folders:
1. `client`: This is where I intend to connect the front end to.

1. `server`: This is where the `required` work will be done

1. `database`: This is where all of the database files (example: schemas/models, routers, ect.) will be.



The answers will be located in the `details` folder.
